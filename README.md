# Project_Manager

As a project manager, I actively monitor and track project progress by utilizing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sprint burndown rates, velocity, and project delivery metrics. These tools allow me to assess team performance, identify potential bottlenecks, and ensure we stay on course to meet project goals. 

Sprint burndown charts help visualize the work completed versus what remains, providing real-time insight into whether the team is on track. Velocity measures the average amount of work completed during a sprint, enabling more accurate forecasting for future sprints. Additionally, project delivery metrics help ensure that milestones are met on time, allowing me to make data-driven adjustments to keep the project aligned with stakeholder expectations. This structured approach helps maintain transparency, drive efficiency, and ensure the successful delivery of project objectives.
